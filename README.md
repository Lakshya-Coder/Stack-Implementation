# Stack-Implementation
This is a very easy implementation of the stack by linked list. I write this code in java.

## Requirement

- JDK
- VS Code

### Step 1 - Installing JDK

You need to install [**JDK ![JDK](https://www.hashmat00.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/jdk1.jpg)**](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

#### Check for your JDK install or not
Try to run these commands in terminal or cmd.

```bash
java --version
```

```bash
javac
```

```bash
java
```

If you getting the error so you did not set the environment variables 
and this problem only faces in `windows users`.

### Step 2 -  Installing Visual Studio Code

Then we install [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
just because it was a lightweight text editor and you install many plugins.

> And you are good to go!
